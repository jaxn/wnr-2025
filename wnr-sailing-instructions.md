# PPYC Wednesday Night Racing – Sailing Instructions 2024

Percy Priest Yacht Club (PPYC) runs a weekly **Wednesday Night Racing (WNR)** series on Percy Priest Lake in Nashville, Tennessee.  These sailing instructions summarize the procedures, scoring and safety considerations for the 2024 WNR series.

## Starting process

- **Starting line** –  The starting line is **on the marina side of the central and southern‑most “No Wake” buoys** (two rightmost buoys when sailing out of the marina) at the entrance to the cove.  Racers should familiarize themselves with the marks.

- **Zero Time / countdown** –  The racing **countdown (“Zero Time”) normally starts at 6:00 PM**, but the time may be adjusted by competitors if weather or other conditions warrant.  Each participating boat receives its own **pursuit start time** measured from Zero Time.  Boats start when their countdown expires and should avoid loitering in the starting area during other boats’ starts.

- **Start‑time lists and time accuracy** –  Pursuit start times are published online (link in the series’ documents).  Competitors should use an accurate time source (e.g., the U.S. atomic clock at [time.gov](https://www.time.gov/)) when timing their starts.

## Racing rules

PPYC WNR uses the **Racing Rules of Sailing (RRS)** with simplified guidance:

- A **ten‑point primer on racing rules** is available via the “Basic Racing Rules” link.
- Boats are expected to sail safely, avoid collisions and show sportsmanship.  Protests are discouraged; the goal is friendly competition.  See the **Protest Process** section below.

## Classes and fleets

- Two classes are offered: **Spinnaker** and **Non‑Spinnaker**.
- The **Bee fleet** is **suspended** pending review.
- Boats must select a class at the beginning of the series and will be scored in that class.
- A **Spinnaker‑class boat that does not fly a spinnaker** in a race is still scored as Spinnaker.  A **Non‑Spinnaker boat that deploys a spinnaker** is scored **“Did Not Compete” (DNC)** for that race.

## Reverse course nights

To build different sailing skills, **the first Wednesday of each month** is a **reverse‑course night**.  On these evenings the course is sailed in the opposite direction.  If a short course is adopted on a reverse‑course night, there will be a **starboard rounding** at the Rock mark.

## Scoring

PPYC uses a **Low‑Point scoring system**:

- Series scoring follows the Low Score format of the RRS.
- **Drop races** – Because the series runs over many weeks, each boat is allowed **one dropped score for every four races**.
- **DNC scoring** – A boat that does not participate in a race normally receives a **DNC** score equal to the number of series competitors (but **not** plus 1).
- **Rule A5 modifications** – Rule A5.2 is changed so that a boat that came to the starting area but did not start, did not sail the course, did not finish, retired or was disqualified will be scored one point more than the number of boats that came to the starting area.  Rule A5.3 applies as written.
- **Travel regatta exceptions** – With Race Director approval, a skipper who misses a race for a travel regatta may be awarded a **“mid‑fleet” score** based on the number of participants.
- **Crew / boat substitutions** – A boat may be raced by crew other than the normal skipper and still be scored.  A registered skipper may sail a different boat in the same class and count that score, but only **one** of these substitution options may be used for scoring.

## Protest process

The WNR series emphasizes **sportsmanship and fun**; there is **no official protest committee**.  If you realize you have violated a rule, take the appropriate **penalty turns** (typically one turn for start‑line infractions and two turns for other violations).  Should a breach be discovered after the fact, the Race Director may assign an appropriate scoring penalty.

## Weather cancellation

Safety is paramount.  Races may be cancelled for **thunderstorms, lightning or severe weather warnings**.  Skippers are always responsible for deciding whether they feel conditions are safe.  Because summer storms are common in Nashville, the Race Committee aims to err on the side of caution but to avoid unnecessary cancellations.  Skipper feedback is welcome.

## Shortening the course

- If the **forecast wind is less than ~3 knots**, the series normally switches to a **short course**.  Forecasts are not always reliable, and conditions may improve unexpectedly, so competitors should be prepared for either course.
- The course may also be shortened due to **impending weather or darkness**, either at the discretion of the Race Director or by consensus of the majority of competitors.
- **Flag S** flown from the **Hamilton Creek flagpole** signals a short course.  A short course may also be announced on the water via hailing or VHF channel 68.  Please help relay the message to all competitors.
- When a short course is called during a reverse‑course night, the **Rock mark** will be rounded **to starboard**.

## Short course for Non‑Spin class

For 2024, the **short course is the standard course for the Non‑Spinnaker class**.  The goal is to return the fleet before dark and keep boats together.  Competitors may sail the long course if conditions permit, but **all boats in the class must sail the same course**.  Course decisions are made by majority vote.

## Crew matching program

PPYC encourages new sailors to join the fleet.  Each weekly race will have a **registration link for prospective crew**.  Skippers are asked to inform the Race Director or Crew Coordinator of **available crew slots**.  A **novice‑slot scoring incentive** awards up to two points of improvement (but never better than first place) for skippers who take novice crew.

## Post‑race social

A post‑race social gathering typically follows each WNR race, fostering camaraderie among skippers and crews.  Details are provided by the Race Director each week.
