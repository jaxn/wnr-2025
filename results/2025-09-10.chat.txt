[9/10/25, 1:45:33 PM] George Darling: Ambush is in. Rule 42.3 (i) allows for the sailing instructions to permit propulsion in certain circumstances. Could one of those circumstances please be, “light air, as determined by the skipper”? 😀

[9/11/25, 5:48:34 AM] Mark Smith: Itch, unknown ahead and behind. 1 novice.
[9/11/25, 6:30:34 AM] Mark Smith: Last night’s race was a joy. Light but steady breeze with the typical Hamilton Creek new breeze finish, temps were not sweat to death hot. For me when I’m on the boat concentrating on getting every ounce of speed allows me to escape. Yesterday was a tough day in our country but just another chapter in a tough season for our country. Our sailing community, what we are creating with these sailboats, is something special. We don’t talk politics (what’s the point) we just love and enjoy each other. Sailing with an old friend, Steve, newer friends, Jess, Emily and Carolina, and a newest one, Antonio, just makes me smile. Thanks Bill for letting us use Itch. See everyone on the water! Just show up and be surprised
[9/11/25, 6:32:27 AM] Alicia Noble: Ambush ahead, Wizard, Itch behind.
[9/11/25, 9:55:09 AM] Chris Berkey: Beatit: Dnf due to late start, dead battery, so no lights to stay out on course with. Not the point, we had a great time and just getting the boat back out there was the win. Boat feels great, seemed nimble and responsive to control in the light wind. We have a few technical issue we found to solve but that’s all part of it.
[9/11/25, 9:56:52 AM] Chris Berkey: Very much enjoyed and appreciated the assembled crew of Kate, Robbie and Asa for maiden voyage! Thanks to all who got them in contact with me to crew!
[9/11/25, 10:49:02 AM] George Heintz: Congrats. Welcome to the PPYC Fleet!
