## Summary

Race abandoned due to lightning after start. Three boats (Scooter, Itch, Ambush) started then turned back. No finish sequence evidence.

## Ambiguity

All boats have full positional uncertainty (any finishing order could have occurred) because no relative placement or finish list was recorded before abandonment.

## Evidence

- [2025-04-23 18:39:36] Jackson — Scooter, Itch, and Ambush went out and started the race. Only to turn back once the lightning came. The rest of the fleet had better sense, but less fun :)
  - Interpreted: all three started then did not finish => DNF, positions irrecoverable.
