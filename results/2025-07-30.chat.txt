We have 6 people signed up to crew. Kate is out of town this week, so I’d love some help on the dock helping place people tonight.

And the forecast looks mixed. There is a chance we will make a short course. If so, that announcement will be on WhatsApp, no later than 5:50pm

[8/2/25, 9:50:42 AM] ~ Joy Grapentine: Good morning! Anyone know who just took out Manner? I had it reserved this morning...
[8/2/25, 5:38:19 PM] ~ John Calvano: Joy, What happened?
[8/2/25, 5:44:12 PM] ~ Joy Grapentine: It sounds like both parties had reserved the boat before today, but the website didn't save either reservation. When I checked this morning to see if anyone had it reserved after me, I saw my reservation hadn't saved and re-reserved, but the other sailer (understandably) didn't double check this morning--he assumed he had the boat. Just a weird tech glitch! We chatted. All good.
[8/2/25, 8:53:44 PM] Phillip Lehner: Buried him at sea. Got it.
[8/3/25, 8:24:23 AM] ~ John Calvano: Thanks Joy.
[8/4/25, 10:44:00 AM] Mark Smith: There was a drowning at Hamilton Creek Saturday at 2pm. David Holcroft age 74. Adjusting his sail on the bow, waves hit taking him overboard. No life jacket. Yes it’s hot, they are unattractive and annoying but let’s commit to PFDs. Be safe friends.
[8/4/25, 10:57:49 AM] Ania: Did this happen at the marina yesterday? Was he a sailor?

[8/4/25, 11:49:45 AM] Paul Latour: Hmmm. Unanswered questions.  He
[8/4/25, 11:57:53 AM] Paul Heinz: Considering his wife was on the boat with him and should have been able to toss him a line/off/etc. I'd bet money either there was a head injury on the way down or he was drunk.
[8/4/25, 11:58:03 AM] Paul Heinz: Pfd*
[8/4/25, 11:59:50 AM] Paul Latour: Yes, or stress-induced heart attack.
[8/4/25, 2:54:56 PM] James ODell: Unfortunately, No pfd,
[8/4/25, 5:18:14 PM] Bill Elders: We were there. Zero wind. Zero waves. I don’t know where this would have taken place.
[8/4/25, 5:20:06 PM] ~ Brad: Saturday v Sunday? I thought there was wind Saturday, whereas v15s on Sunday had no wind
[8/4/25, 5:20:59 PM] Bill Elders: I’m sorry, I thought the report said it was on Sunday. Was it Saturday?
[8/4/25, 5:21:11 PM] James ODell: Wake boat is my guess, perfect day for those folks.
[8/4/25, 10:18:24 PM] Brian Dougherty: Our J22 sailing friends at Eagle Creek experienced a similar tragic event last month when a young woman drowned after diving off a sailboat.
[8/4/25, 10:18:58 PM] Brian Dougherty: https://www.wishtv.com/news/local-news/sailboat-diving-tragedy-eagle-creek-reservoir/
[8/4/25, 10:22:14 PM] Brian Dougherty: Another tragic sailing related accident happened last week during youth sailing camp at the Miami Yacht Club.
[8/4/25, 10:22:17 PM] Brian Dougherty: https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/as-loved-ones-mourn-3-girls-killed-in-biscayne-bay-sailboat-crash-victims-attorney-says-there-is-a-lot-of-fault-to-go-around/
[8/4/25, 10:25:54 PM] Brian Dougherty: These tragic events are painful reminders that wearing a life jacket while sailing is a crucial safety practice, no matter your experience level or the conditions. Even strong swimmers can be incapacitated in cold or rough water. Sudden boat movements, weather changes, or slips can send anyone overboard. Calm water can become dangerous in minutes, especially with heavy boat traffic. And, a bright-colored life jacket can help with quick recovery.  

Be aware that recent updates in the law require self-inflating life jackets to be worn. Other standard jackets must fit properly and be readily accessible. 

Best practice is to always wear your PFD while on the water.  Remember that the high freeboard on many sailboats can make getting back onboard a challenge. In the event you end up in the water, you’re life jacket may be the key safety feature that saves your life.

In 2023, among boating fatalities from drowning, 87% of the victims were not wearing a life jacket.
