## Summary

Ambiguous ordering due to conflicting adjacency claims (Itch vs Wizard vs Danger Zone) and multiple unconstrained boats.

| Pos | Boat | Range | Novices | Status | Score | AliasesSeen |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| ? | Psycho Killer | 1–5 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["J80"] |
| ? | Scalded Dawg | 2–6 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Dawg", "Dawgs"] |
| ? | Go Hogs Go | 3–7 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Go hogs", "Go Hogs"] |
| ? | Scooter | 4–8 | 2 | FIN | ? | ["Scooter"] |
| ? | Itch | 5–9 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Itch"] |
| ? | Danger Zone | 1–11 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Danger Zone"] |
| ? | Wizard | 6–11 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Wizard"] |
| ? | Sweet Virginia | 7–11 | 2 | FIN | ? | ["Sweet virginia"] |
| ? | Club J22 | 1–10 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["club boat", "club j22"] |
| ? | Fred | 1–10 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Fast Freddie", "Fred"] |
| ? | Dandelion | 2–11 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Dandelion"] |

Scoring deferred pending resolution because positional ranges are broad and overlapping.

## Ambiguity

Conflicts & gaps:

1. Sam: "Itch in front. Wizard behind" (interprets adjacency Itch > Wizard).
2. Jackson: "Scooter -> Itch -> Danger Zone -> Wizard -> Sweet Virginia?" inserts Danger Zone between Itch and Wizard and places Sweet Virginia at tail, but notes uncertainty ('?').
3. Club J22 only referenced relative to Sweet Virginia (ahead) leaving its placement elsewhere free.
4. Fred/Dandelion only linked by "Dandelion closely behind fast Freddie" (Fred > Dandelion) with no ties to other chains.

Result: Multiple linear extensions; three illustrative examples:

- Psycho Killer, Scalded Dawg, Go Hogs Go, Scooter, Itch, Danger Zone, Wizard, Sweet Virginia, Club J22, Fred, Dandelion
- Club J22, Fred, Dandelion, Psycho Killer, Scalded Dawg, Go Hogs Go, Scooter, Itch, Wizard, Sweet Virginia, Danger Zone
- Fred, Psycho Killer, Scalded Dawg, Go Hogs Go, Club J22, Scooter, Itch, Danger Zone, Wizard, Sweet Virginia, Dandelion
