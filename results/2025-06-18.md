## Summary

Ambiguous ordering: Jackson clarification chain excluded (not treated as evidence). Remaining independent sub-chains produce broad interleaving ambiguity.

| Pos | Boat | Range | Novices | Status | Score | AliasesSeen |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| ? | Psycho Killer | 1–7 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["J80"] |
| ? | Scalded Dawg | 2–8 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Dawg", "Dawgs"] |
| ? | Go Hogs Go | 3–9 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Go hogs", "Go Hogs"] |
| ? | Scooter | 4–10 | 2 | FIN | ? | ["Scooter"] |
| ? | Itch | 1–9 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Itch"] |
| ? | Wizard | 2–10 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Wizard"] |
| ? | Sweet Virginia | 2–10 | 2 | FIN | ? | ["Sweet virginia"] |
| ? | Club J22 | 1–9 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["club boat", "club j22"] |
| ? | Fred | 1–9 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Fast Freddie", "Fred"] |
| ? | Dandelion | 2–10 | 0 | FIN | ? | ["Dandelion"] |

Scoring deferred pending resolution because positional ranges are broad and overlapping. (Danger Zone removed from ambiguous set after chain exclusion.)

## Ambiguity

Independent sub-chains retained (after excluding Jackson clarification):

1. Psycho Killer > Scalded Dawg > Go Hogs Go > Scooter
2. Itch > Wizard
3. Club J22 > Sweet Virginia
4. Fred > Dandelion

No edges connect these; they can interleave arbitrarily while respecting internal order. Representative examples:

- Psycho Killer, Scalded Dawg, Go Hogs Go, Scooter, Itch, Wizard, Club J22, Sweet Virginia, Fred, Dandelion
- Club J22, Sweet Virginia, Itch, Wizard, Psycho Killer, Scalded Dawg, Go Hogs Go, Scooter, Fred, Dandelion
- Fred, Dandelion, Itch, Wizard, Club J22, Sweet Virginia, Psycho Killer, Scalded Dawg, Go Hogs Go, Scooter
