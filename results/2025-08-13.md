Starters = 7. Score = max(1, pos - novice_deduction). Novice deductions: Dawg (1), Go Hogs Go (1), Scooter (2), Fred (1). Evidence: Dawg novice explicit (two messages). Scooter novice total = 2 derived from combination of early "2 NV" group line (interpreted as two novices across listed boats) plus later explicit 1 novice line confirming at least one; user clarification sets final Scooter novices = 2. Fred novice confirmed by later explicit list. No novice for Itch or Sweet Virginia.

- [Authoritative] Final order supplied

### Novice Clarification

User clarification: Hogs had 1 novice; Scooter had 2 novices; Fred had 1 novice. We map this to evidence lines: (a) "GoHogs / Dawg ahead / Scooter behind / 1 novice" ambiguous but supports at least one novice among involved boats; (b) "Gog hogs, Scooter, Fast Freddie. 2 NV" indicates novices present across that set; (c) the next-morning explicit list confirms at least 1 for Scooter and Fred. Final assignment reconciles to Hogs 1, Scooter 2, Fred 1; Dawg 1 via separate confirmation; others 0.

## Ambiguity

Finish order unambiguous (authoritative). Novice allocation for Go Hogs Go carries minor uncertainty; if later evidence shows 0 novices, adjust its score from 3 to 4.
