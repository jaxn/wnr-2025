# Wednesday Night Race – 2025-09-03

## Summary

Race ABANDONED. At 17:55:16 (local) Race Director message: "Abandon". No starts were scored; no finish placements valid. Any subsequent informal messages (e.g., private sails to LaHa) are not race results.

| Pos | Boat | Range | Novices | Status | Score | AliasesSeen |

No scoring awarded due to abandonment before a valid start/finish sequence.

## Ambiguity

None regarding abandonment: explicit directive "Abandon" issued. Insufficient (and irrelevant) placement evidence afterward.
