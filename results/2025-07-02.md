## Ambiguity

Three components emerged: (Danger Zone > Fred > Ambush > Scalded Dawg) implied by combining an earlier message ("No one in front. Fred behind.") with the later block listing Fred / Ambush / Scalded Dawg, a second chain (Scooter > Dandelion > Wizard > Caper), and unlinked Go Hogs Go with only an explicitly uncertain relation to Scooter. No bridging evidence connects these components. Result: wide position ranges and unresolved global order.

Representative consistent orders (examples only):

1. danger zone, fred, ambush, scalded dawg, scooter, dandelion, wizard, caper, go hogs go
2. scooter, dandelion, wizard, caper, go hogs go, danger zone, fred, ambush, scalded dawg
3. danger zone, scooter, fred, dandelion, ambush, go hogs go, wizard, scalded dawg, caper
