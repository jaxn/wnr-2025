## Ambiguity

Two independent ordered chains were reported: (Fred > Ambush > Scalded Dawg) and (Scooter > Dandelion > Wizard > Caper). Go Hogs Go was mentioned without a clear placement relative to either chain. No message links the two chains or firmly orders Go Hogs Go between/among them. One message explicitly states uncertainty between Scooter and Go Hogs Go. Consequently, many linear extensions exist and no unique finishing positions or scores can be assigned.

Representative consistent orders (examples only):

1. fred, ambush, scalded dawg, scooter, dandelion, wizard, caper, go hogs go
2. scooter, dandelion, wizard, caper, go hogs go, fred, ambush, scalded dawg
3. fred, scooter, ambush, dandelion, go hogs go, wizard, scalded dawg, caper
