### Novice Clarification

Only one explicit novice statement: Fred Bartrom: "one novice" → Fred novices=1. No other novice mentions; all others set to 0.

### Constraint Derivation

Used adjacency rule on:

- "Psycho in front" + "Dang3r Zone behind." → Psycho Killer ahead of Danger Zone
- "Danger zone ahead, Itch behind." → Danger Zone ahead of Itch
- "Fred ahead,  Dandelion behind" → Fred ahead of Dandelion

Authoritative final order adds remaining relations; no contradictions in collected chat messages.

## Ambiguity

Ordering unambiguous due to authoritative final order and consistent partial chat evidence.
