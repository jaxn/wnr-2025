[8/27/25, 7:39:20 AM] Jackson: Hey hey hey. It’s Wednesday! Who’s sailing? Can you take crew?
[8/27/25, 7:39:43 AM] Jackson: Ambush is out this week. 😢
[8/27/25, 7:39:58 AM] George Heintz: Hogs in.  Don’t know about crew yet
[8/27/25, 7:40:55 AM] ~ Joy Grapentine: I'm in!

[8/27/25, 8:16:40 AM] David Curtze: Scooter is out due to issue with boat.  Scooter will be pulled out today for repair.
[8/27/25, 8:23:01 AM] Robby: Dandelion is in 👍
[8/27/25, 8:24:18 AM] Brian Dougherty: Tune into “Local on 2” this Friday for a nice PR piece on PPYC.  

When: August 29 @ 2PM
Where: Channel 2
What: LATH program
[8/27/25, 8:26:55 AM] Max Sadler: I’m in

[8/27/25, 8:45:37 AM] Alicia Noble: Wizard is in
[8/27/25, 8:47:19 AM] Jeremy Odom: Sweet Virginia is in
[8/27/25, 9:09:56 AM] Sam Beckman: Reminder. According to WNR SI. Short course decision shall be made no later than 5:45. Since Race Director ( Jackson) is out the decision is “ by consensus of 3 or more racing skippers”. Hoping we don’t need it.
[8/27/25, 12:39:32 PM] Ania: I plan on racing today! On club j-22 or whatever most available.
[8/27/25, 12:39:33 PM] Chris Berkey: I’m planning to be there. @⁨David Curtze⁩ I can help you pull Scooter if you want.
-Chris Berkey
[8/27/25, 12:43:14 PM] Chris Berkey: @⁨Ania⁩ club j22 is out unless we reconnect the starboard shroud that became undone when the split ring came out of the pin at the bottom of the turnbuckle.
[8/27/25, 12:45:26 PM] ~ Theodore Miesner: Looks like Joe had already fixed it
[8/27/25, 12:50:27 PM] Chris Berkey: Excellent!
[8/27/25, 12:53:19 PM] George Heintz: Joe Rocks and people need to tell him so!
[8/27/25, 1:15:55 PM] George Heintz: Reminder to use new starting times if we do short course

[8/27/25, 1:59:48 PM] James ODell: I think there may be an error in the starting times. The times are  are based on the long course being 2.8 miles and the short course 2.2 miles. One of those distances is incorrect. The long course is more than .6 miles longer than the short course, it’s probably closer to twice the length. If the starting times are calculated on the above mileage one or both times are incorrect.
[8/27/25, 2:06:48 PM] George Heintz: Sam measured the short course to calculate new times. Long course has not had similar remeasurement. Heck buoys aren’t in same place week to week.  Needs to be measured too.
[8/27/25, 2:08:33 PM] Mark Smith: One design! Do I hear the quiet building whisper of one design racing of keelboats in Nashville?  I know, I know, I’m a fool for dreaming that two sailors can agree on anything but can you stop and imagine 15 J22s or S2s every Wednesday night?  Wow, gives me goosebumps. The comaraderie and competition would be the envy of every club around. I’d be the first to sell any of my boats to start this momentum. Ok, I’ll climb back under my rock now. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/27/25, 2:24:06 PM] Max Sadler: Link doesn't work...
[8/27/25, 2:24:52 PM] Max Sadler: I hear we already decided on J22s 😜
[8/27/25, 3:57:29 PM] Jeff Sonsino: I’m in for a J22 if we are building a fleet.
[8/27/25, 4:02:21 PM] Chris Dupont: Don Yeserski called me, says he tried to sign up and isn’t having success but wants to sail today.
Should I tell him to come on down?
[8/27/25, 4:03:31 PM] Jackson: That probably means the signup is full
[8/27/25, 4:07:17 PM] Chris Dupont: 7/8 from what I saw
[8/27/25, 5:14:23 PM] ~ Rob Bourquin: Looking like a great night for the long course!
[8/27/25, 9:14:28 PM] George Heintz: Psycho in front
Dang3r Zone behind.
[8/27/25, 9:17:58 PM] George Heintz: It did for awhile
[8/27/25, 9:18:37 PM] James ODell: Danger zone ahead, Itch behind.
[8/27/25, 9:23:09 PM] Jeremy Odom: - max ahead 
- ⁠sweet Virginia 
- ⁠behind?
[8/27/25, 9:23:52 PM] Fred Bartrom: one novice, we were between the packs
[8/28/25, 6:45:00 AM] Alicia Noble: Fred ahead,  Dandelion behind or we’ll call it a tie 😉
[8/28/25, 4:50:39 PM] George Darling: I would like to extend an invitation to all Percy Priest skippers to take part in any of the HIYC keelboat regattas this fall. This year, we clarified in our notice of race documents that the regattas are open to any skippers invited by an HIYC member, so please take this as your official invitation. The regatta dates are Sept 6, Oct 11, Nov 1, Nov 9, Nov 15, Nov 16, and Dec 6. You can register online here (no account needed) https://hiyc.org/calendar 

The regattas on Nov 15 and 16 are long distance races. The rest will be shorter, likely with multiple races in a day with more W/L courses than we have traditionally done.

If there are three or more boats of the same kind, we've also clarified that you may opt to race one-design! We only have plans for trophies for our regular PHRF fleets however, since we don't know who to expect at this point.
[8/28/25, 4:56:37 PM] George Heintz: Nice touch. Definitely will consider.
[8/28/25, 8:49:13 PM] David Curtze: Thanks George D.
[8/31/25, 11:33:12 AM] Brian Smokler: What George Darling said. I guess I don't read the race instructions well enough. Our races have always been open to anyone who wants to participate. We have guest slips if anyone want to bring a boat over. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/2/25, 4:04:59 PM] Fred Bartrom: Rookie Race training is this Saturday 1:00-4:00. Then the Rookie Race is the following Saturday, the 13th. 

1. Training: Sam Beckman will be helping teach the class. He is great with so many topics. I could use one more person to help with the teaching this Saturday. I have several additional topics to choose from. Reach out to me and I will plug you in.

2. Race Day: Saturday the 13th. 
	A. I would like to offer an experienced sailor to take my boat out to coach and help Rookies experience the race. It is Jib and Main only on a simple triangle course.
        B.  I will be running the race and could use a couple of people to help with that as well. We need someone who can operate the mark boat (three marks) and a couple of helpers one on the mark boat and one on the committee boat. We really keep this race simple and fun.
	C. If you have a boat, we need other skippers to come out and host Rookies on your boat. Bring a rookie or two with you! Thanks for those who have already signed up!
