We will cover setting marks and MOB training.

We have had two challenging incidents this season, both with problems while setting marks and a MOB during the Galen Freeman.  

We all need to be better prepared and practice safety procedures.  

It is just like a life jacket, it doesn’t work, if you ignore it. ‎<This message was edited>
