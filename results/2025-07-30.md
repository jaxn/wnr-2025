## Evidence

### Scalded Dawg

- [2025-07-30 13:13:06] James ODell — Dawgs in
- [2025-07-30 20:22:52] Jackson — Dawg ahead / Ambush / [insert name here] behind (implies Dawg ahead of Ambush)
- [2025-07-30 20:56:03] James ODell — Dawg ahead of ambush, one novice (confirms Dawg > Ambush + 1 novice)

### Ambush

- [2025-07-30 12:02:37] Jackson — Ambush is in and needs crew
- [2025-07-30 20:22:52] Jackson — Dawg ahead / Ambush / [insert name here] behind (Ambush between Dawg and unknown)
- [2025-07-30 20:24:11] Fred Bartrom — 519 behind ambush (places Fred after Ambush)
- [2025-07-31 06:47:38] Mark Smith — 2 of the 3 S2s say we were over early. Scooter was DNS. (indirect: confirms Scooter not a finisher; order segment unaffected)

### Fred

- [2025-07-30 12:13:47] Fred Bartrom — im in
- [2025-07-30 20:24:11] Fred Bartrom — 519 behind ambush (Fred behind Ambush; 519 sail number alias)

### Psycho Killer

- [2025-07-31 08:53:35] Bill Elders — Psycho Killer ahead / Itch (1 novice) / Scooter behind—if they’re DNS I don’t know who was behind them. (Chain Psycho > Itch > Scooter)

### Itch

- [2025-07-30 12:14:17] Bill Elders — Itchin’
- [2025-07-31 08:53:35] Bill Elders — Psycho Killer ahead / Itch (1 novice) / Scooter behind—if they’re DNS... (Itch behind Psycho; 1 novice)

### Scooter (DNS)

- [2025-07-30 10:15:59] Mark Smith — Scooter is in. (Intent to race)
- [2025-07-31 06:47:38] Mark Smith — 2 of the 3 S2s say we were over early. Scooter was DNS. (Explicit DNS)
- [2025-07-31 08:53:35] Bill Elders — Psycho Killer ahead / Itch (1 novice) / Scooter behind—if they’re DNS... (Placement reference but overridden by DNS status)

### Wizard

- [2025-07-30 10:36:12] Alicia Noble — Wizard is in.
- [2025-07-30 20:23:43] Jeremy Odom — - wizard ahead / - sweet Virginia (1 novice) / - go hogs behind (list: Wizard > Sweet Virginia > Go Hogs; novice for Sweet Virginia)
- [2025-07-30 20:53:03] Alicia Noble — Not sure who was ahead. / Wizard - 1 novice / Sweet Virginia behind (Wizard > Sweet Virginia; 1 novice for Wizard)

- [2025-07-30 20:53:03] Alicia Noble — Not sure who was ahead. / Wizard - 1 novice / Sweet Virginia behind (confirms ordering; separate novice for Wizard only)
- [2025-07-30 20:51:07] George Heintz — Sweet Virginia Ahead Flying Scot behind??? No novice credits... (Conflicting relative to Jeremy earlier; resolved by authoritative final order)

- [2025-07-30 20:51:07] George Heintz — Sweet Virginia Ahead Flying Scot behind??? (No change to Go Hogs position; Flying Scot ignored)

### Authoritative Order

- [Provided by user] Dawg > Ambush > Fred > Psycho > Itch > Scooter (DNS) > Wizard > Sweet Virginia > Hogs (Overrides conflicting Sweet Virginia / Flying Scot observation and any partial uncertainty.)

## Ambiguity

None. Conflicting mid-race reports (e.g., Sweet Virginia vs Flying Scot position) overridden by authoritative order supplied after the fact.
