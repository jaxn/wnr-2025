## Summary

Applying direct-adjacency "behind" rule collapses prior ambiguity: each "behind" is interpreted as immediately trailing the named boat within a single chain.

| Pos | Boat | Range | Novices | Status | Score | AliasesSeen |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | Psycho Killer | 1–1 | 0 | FIN | 1 | ["Psycho killa", "Psycho Killer"] |
| 2 | Ambush | 2–2 | 0 | FIN | 2 | ["Ambush"] |
| 3 | Fred | 3–3 | 0 | FIN | 3 | ["Frediie", "Fred"] |
| 4 | Sweet Virginia | 4–4 | 0 | FIN | 4 | ["Sweet Virginia"] |
| 5 | Wizard | 5–5 | 0 | DNF | 6 | ["Wizard"] |

Scoring unchanged for finishers; Wizard DNF gets starters+1 (5+1=6).
