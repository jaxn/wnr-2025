## Evidence

### Psycho Killer

- [2025-09-17 19:29:13] Jackson — "Psycho Killer ahead" (Psycho ahead of following boats)
- [Authoritative] Final order supplied

### Ambush

- [2025-09-17 11:18:01] Jackson — "Ambush is in" (starter)
- [2025-09-17 19:29:13] Jackson — chain message block listing Ambush after Psycho Killer
- [2025-09-18 08:03:13] Fred Bartrom — "ambush ahead" (reinforces Ambush ahead of at least one trailing boat)
- [2025-09-18 10:43:50] Brian Smokler — "Ambush ahead & Caper behind (or did Robbie take him?)" (Ambush ahead of Caper)
- [Authoritative] Final order supplied

### Fred

- [2025-09-17 19:29:13] Jackson — "Fred or Caper behind (not sure how that played out)" (places Fred somewhere behind Ambush; ambiguous relative to Caper)
- [2025-09-18 08:03:13] Fred Bartrom — "ambush ahead" (implies Fred behind Ambush still; no new info vs Caper)
- [Authoritative] Final order supplied (resolves Fred vs Caper ordering)

### Caper

- [2025-09-17 19:29:13] Jackson — "Fred or Caper behind (not sure how that played out)" (Caper behind Ambush; ambiguous vs Fred)
- [2025-09-18 10:43:50] Brian Smokler — "Ambush ahead & Caper behind (or did Robbie take him?)" (Caper behind Ambush)
- [Authoritative] Final order supplied (places Caper behind Fred)

### Beat It

- [2025-09-17 11:46:48] Chris Berkey — "Beat It ready for more shakeout" (starter intent)
- [2025-09-18 10:40:09] Chris Berkey — "Beat It bringing up the rear again..." (Beat It last)
- [Authoritative] Final order supplied

### Unused / Other Boats Mentioned (Not in Final Order)

Pre-race "is in" messages for Dandelion, Wizard, Hogs, Sweet Virginia, Itch appear but none have finish placement evidence in transcript; they are excluded from starters here per authoritative final order limitation. Novice mention "1 newby on the boat with us (Don)" (Brian Smokler) not attributable to a scored boat with certainty → excluded.

### Constraint Derivation

Partial order from evidence (before authoritative override):

- Psycho Killer > Ambush
- Ambush > Caper
- Beat It last (behind all others)
- Fred and Caper both behind Ambush but relative order unresolved (range Fred ∈ {3,4}, Caper ∈ {3,4})

Authoritative order resolves Fred ahead of Caper; final ranges collapse to single positions.

## Ambiguity

Evidence alone leaves Fred/Caper ordering ambiguous; authoritative final order supplied removes ambiguity. Final results marked unambiguous.
