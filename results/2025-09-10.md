## Summary

Authoritative final order: Psycho Killer > Danger Zone > Go Hogs Go > Ambush > Wizard > Itch > Beat It (DNF).

| Pos | Boat | Range | Novices | Status | Score | AliasesSeen |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | Psycho Killer | 1–1 | 0 | FIN | 1 | ["Psychokiller"] |
| 2 | Danger Zone | 2–2 | 2 | FIN | 1 | ["Danger Zone"] |
| 3 | Go Hogs Go | 3–3 | 1 | FIN | 2 | ["Hogs"] |
| 4 | Ambush | 4–4 | 0 | FIN | 4 | ["Ambush"] |
| 5 | Wizard | 5–5 | 0 | FIN | 5 | ["Wizard"] |
| 6 | Itch | 6–6 | 1 | FIN | 5 | ["Itch"] |
| 7 | Beat It | 7–7 | 0 | DNF | 8 | ["Beatit"] |

Starters = 7 (Beat It started but DNF). Score formula: FIN score = max(1, pos - min(2, novices)); DNF score = starters + 1 - min(2, novices) = 8 here. Danger Zone’s two novices reduce score from 2 → 1. Hogs/Ambush/Itch each have 1 novice reducing score by 1. Psycho Killer no novice claim. Wizard no novice claim.
