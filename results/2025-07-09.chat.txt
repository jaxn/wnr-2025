[7/9/25, 2:53:30 PM] George Darling: Does anyone have a crystal ball to say if we are going to get thunderstorms at Percy Priest tonight or not? There's some big ones further south-west that will be in Columbia in about an hour.
[7/9/25, 2:54:58 PM] Max Sadler: All my crystal balls are in the shop!
[7/9/25, 2:55:43 PM] George Heintz: We cancelled LATH last night mostly because looked like rain just beforehand.  Not a drop of rain occurred.  Not much wind either. My crystal ball is broken!
[7/9/25, 2:55:57 PM] George Darling: Tea leaves are an acceptable substitute.
[7/9/25, 2:57:49 PM] Mark Smith: My mantra: dock disappointment trumps sofa sadness
[7/9/25, 4:16:23 PM] Bill Elders: It’s strange out here on pier 1. Lightning across the lake but appears to be moving slowly off to the east and dissipating. Dead calm in the cove at the moment so all wind indicators are pointing different directions. So I guess it’s all on this thing to the south whether it kisses us with its wind or blasts us. Very hard to tell. Russell said they’ve had funk all around but no rain to speak of today. For what it’s worth—very similar to our dinghie racing weather this past Sunday.

[7/9/25, 8:57:34 PM] George Heintz: Go hogs DSQ. Missed a buoy on top end.  Thats what we get for following Scooter.  At least we had 1 Novice.
[7/9/25, 9:25:04 PM] Max Sadler: I followed go hogs!
[7/9/25, 10:02:46 PM] David Curtze: Itch ahead go hogs go behind. 1 nv.
Scooter and go hogs  missed a mark.
Dsq? Consider last and 2nd to last.  If max also missed the mark, then last, 2nd to last and 3rd to last. 
Thuse marks move around so much,  you never know where they are.
[7/9/25, 10:03:19 PM] George Heintz: True that!!!
[7/9/25, 10:13:49 PM] Mark Smith: Honestly, we were fixated on a spinnaker issue so Jesus could’ve been walking on the water and we’d missed it too.
[7/9/25, 10:58:24 PM] Bill Elders: I saw the mark!

What a blast of a night!
[7/9/25, 10:58:59 PM] Bill Elders: Great night of sailing. Gotta go out there
[7/9/25, 11:35:18 PM] Fred Bartrom: Max went back and rounded the mark. finished behind us.
[7/9/25, 11:47:37 PM] James ODell: Anyone that didn’t sail the course should be scored DNF, the rules are very clear on this point.
[7/10/25, 12:29:16 AM] Jackson: We don’t really have SIs for WNR (we should), so I would like to ask if any skipper objects to rule A5.3 being in effect. I feel that is the cleanest way to align series scoring to the spirit of WNR.

In essence, it is DNF (or DSQ, but I think James is right) being scored as the number of boats finishing + 1, instead of the number of boats registered for the series + 1. 

I believe it makes no sense to score a DNC/DNS the same as a boat that went out and made an effort to sail the course.
