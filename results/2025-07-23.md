# Wednesday Night Race – 2025-07-23

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

## Summary

All boats that started are being scored DNF by post-race consensus (course / start procedure irregularities). Any observed on-the-water ordering is ignored for scoring. Novice deductions still applied to the DNF penalty per policy.

| Pos | Boat | Range | Novices | Status | Score | AliasesSeen |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| ? | Ambush | 1–10 | 0 | DNF | 11 | ["Ambush"] |
| ? | Itch | 1–10 | 0 | DNF | 11 | ["Itchin’", "Itch"] |
| ? | Caper | 1–10 | 0 | DNF | 11 | ["Caper"] |
| ? | Go Hogs Go | 1–10 | 0 | DNF | 11 | ["Go Hogs"] |
| ? | Wizard | 1–10 | 0 | DNF | 11 | ["Wizard"] |
| ? | Scalded Dawg | 1–10 | 0 | DNF | 11 | ["Dawgs"] |
| ? | Scooter | 1–10 | 2 | DNF | 9 | ["Scooters", "Scooter"] |
| ? | Psycho Killer | 1–10 | 0 | DNF | 11 | ["Psycho"] |
| ? | Danger Zone | 1–10 | 0 | DNF | 11 | ["Danger Zone"] |
| ? | Fred | 1–10 | 2 | DNF | 9 | ["Fred"] |

Scoring notes: Starters = 10 so DNF base = 11. Novice deductions: Scooter (2) → 11-2=9, Fred (2) → 9. Minimum score floor (1) not invoked.

## Ambiguity

All finish positions intentionally suppressed (mass DNF ruling). Partial order evidence existed (e.g., Go Hogs > Scooter > Caper; Ambush ahead of Wizard and Itch; Psycho Killer > Danger Zone) but is moot for scoring. Ranges shown (1–10) reflect that any ordering could have been possible in absence of an official finish.

## Evidence
