[8/6/25, 7:29:42 AM] Jackson: Today is the day! Who’s in?

We have 7 people signed up to crew.

The forecast looks bleak to me.
[8/6/25, 7:31:05 AM] George Heintz: I am out driving back from Pcola. Pablo is welcome to sail Go Hogs.
[8/6/25, 7:33:03 AM] ~ Joy Grapentine: I'm in on itch
[8/6/25, 7:42:12 AM] ~ David: I’d crew!
[8/6/25, 8:28:41 AM] ~ Greg Wood: I’m available to crew
[8/6/25, 8:30:01 AM] ~ Theodore Miesner: I can crew or I can take the club boat out under jib and main (unless the ring has been installed again)
[8/6/25, 8:34:25 AM] Brandon Little: I am available to crew as well
[8/6/25, 8:37:56 AM] Paul Heinz: Unless something changes with the forecast that's a hard no from me
[8/6/25, 9:02:24 AM] Alicia Noble: Wizard is in.
[8/6/25, 9:08:12 AM] ~ Joy Grapentine: Good night to practice capsize drills on Go Hogs? :)
[8/6/25, 9:50:18 AM] Ania: Sorry, I'm out today.
[8/6/25, 10:01:04 AM] Paul Heinz: I don't want to have to deal with taking everything off the boat otherwise I'd say yes
[8/6/25, 10:11:45 AM] Alicia Noble: Theo, want to crew on Wizard?
[8/6/25, 10:34:36 AM] James ODell: Dawgs in
[8/6/25, 10:35:57 AM] Sydney Heinz : Paul, you told me the j22 couldn’t capsize on our 1st date!! I feel lied to.
[8/6/25, 10:38:01 AM] ~ Theodore Miesner: I'd love to!

[8/6/25, 11:54:25 AM] Jackson: Yes, we will use the new/corrected times if we do the short course.

I’m not up to speed on the dry-sailed rating hit. Is that something unique to PPYC? I haven’t heard of other clubs doing that. I agree is should be consistent.
[8/6/25, 11:58:35 AM] Jeremy Odom: Sweet Virginia is in
[8/6/25, 12:00:34 PM] Bill Elders: Itchin’ to sail
[8/6/25, 1:13:46 PM] ~ Joy Grapentine: Change of plans, I am out tonight. Have fun!
[8/6/25, 1:19:07 PM] ~ David: I may also bail… might be good to get more familiar via LATH then come back to race with the adults :)
[8/6/25, 1:19:46 PM] Phillip Lehner: We put “adults” in quotes here.
[8/6/25, 1:20:51 PM] ~ David: I knew I liked y’all 😂 now I’m DEFINITELY coming back to race with the “adults”
[8/6/25, 1:23:46 PM] James ODell: Have the new/corrected times for the short course been posted? If so where please? Thanks.
[8/6/25, 2:04:11 PM] Jackson: Here is the live spreadsheet that is where ratings and start times are kept:

[8/6/25, 2:24:20 PM] Brandon Little: Forecast doesn’t look promising. Think I’ll sit this one out.
[8/6/25, 2:29:47 PM] Max Sadler: Flight is delayed. Still on ground in Dallas. See y’all next week.
[8/6/25, 4:01:56 PM] Brian Dougherty: WNR page indicates we sail reverse course 1st Wednesday of month.  

Just saying: There could be wind…
[8/6/25, 6:02:59 PM] Jackson: SHORT COURSE
[8/6/25, 7:53:30 PM] David Curtze: Fast Freddy ahead Scooter then  Itch ...I think
[8/6/25, 8:00:18 PM] Jeremy Odom: - itch ahead 
- ⁠sweet Virginia 
- ⁠ambush behind
[8/7/25, 5:46:06 AM] Mark Smith: The boats that went out will confirm: there was zero chance of getting a race off until 5:55. The wind filled and stayed perfect for the short course. Just keep it on your calendar and show up. What a night of racing.
[8/7/25, 7:22:06 AM] Ricardo Machion: I totally agree with you @⁨Mark Smith⁩
[8/7/25, 7:24:44 AM] ~ Joy Grapentine: Same thing happened at LATH this week--no wind at 5 followed by fun sailing at 6.
[8/7/25, 7:50:59 AM] Brian Dougherty: “What is meant for you, will come to you, at the right time…”
‎[8/8/25, 12:50:41 PM] ~ Preston Anderson: ‎<attached: 00000674-PHOTO-2025-08-08-12-50-41.jpg>
[8/8/25, 5:33:01 PM] James ODell: Yes, that is Mitch Polger’s boat. He’s the 7.9 class Treasurer, lives in Chicago
[8/8/25, 5:54:51 PM] ~ Preston Anderson: Thanks we got it sorted!
[8/9/25, 5:39:51 PM] ~ Sarah: ‎~ Sarah requested to add ‪+1 (231) 883‑6222‬
[8/10/25, 5:19:18 PM] Jackson: The No Wake Buoys have changed at Hamilton Creek. There are now 4 buoys - it looks to me that the mostly-submerged buoy (the pin end of our start) has been removed and two new ones were added.  It appears to me that the start line may be two small using the right two, and we may now need to use the middle two.

If anyone is out there before Wednesday, please take a look and share your thoughts.
[8/10/25, 5:19:34 PM] ~ Jim Milliman: ‎~ Sarah added ~ Jim Milliman. Tap to change who can add other members.

‎[8/10/25, 5:41:33 PM] Bill Elders: ‎<attached: 00000682-PHOTO-2025-08-10-17-41-33.jpg>
[8/10/25, 5:41:52 PM] Bill Elders: The new buoy is smack dab in the middle of the WNR starting line
‎[8/10/25, 5:55:44 PM] Jackson: ‎<attached: 00000684-PHOTO-2025-08-10-17-55-44.jpg>
[8/10/25, 8:47:23 PM] Jeremy Odom: Has it ever been considered to drop our own small marks to get our start line out of the cove?
[8/10/25, 8:48:01 PM] Brian Dougherty: We observed the same yesterday coming in from J22 Saturday Practice.  

Simple Solution.  
Option 1: Ignore the middle wake buoy
Option 2: Move the other buoys out farther with the middle buoy
Option3: What Jeremy just said
[8/10/25, 10:06:30 PM] Max Sadler: There are two blown up in the shed.
[8/10/25, 10:07:25 PM] Jackson: Dropping marks would be very difficult since start times are based on the distance of the course.
[8/10/25, 10:09:23 PM] ~ John Calvano: Under Option 3, would the last finisher be the one to haul up the marks, rodes and anchors onto their boat and stow them back at the marina? If so, every boat would want to carry containers for them.
[8/10/25, 10:29:48 PM] Paul Latour: Ordinarily, wearing gloves, it is easy to lift these marks and drag where you want them; COE cares not.
[8/11/25, 8:39:51 AM] Bill Elders: If we’re dropping marks, let’s W/L!! 🫠😂
[8/11/25, 4:12:37 PM] George Heintz: Hey Folks.  We have Safety/Chase Boat training scheduled for Sat 23 Aug.  Great prep for RC volunteers (we all should be occasionally volunteering for RC). Please consider attending. Here is a link.
