## Summary

| Pos | Boat | Range | Novices | Status | Score | AliasesSeen |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | Psycho Killer | 1–1 | 0 | FIN | 1 | ["J80"] |
| 2 | Scalded Dawg | 2–2 | 0 | FIN | 2 | ["Scalded Dawg"] |
| 3 | Ambush | 3–3 | 0 | FIN | 3 | ["Ambush"] |
| 4 | Scooter | 4–4 | 0 | FIN | 4 | ["Scooter"] |
| 5 | Fred | 5–5 | 0 | FIN | 5 | ["Fast Freddie", "Fred"] |
| 6 | Go Hogs Go | 6–6 | 0 | FIN | 6 | ["Go Hog Go", "Go hogs go"] |
| 7 | Itch | 7–7 | 0 | FIN | 7 | ["Itch"] |

Ordering constructed from mixed evidence:

1. Relative statements: "Fast Freddie ... Behind Scooter / Ahead Go Hog Go" and "Go hogs go / Behind Fred / Ahead of Itch" produce chain Scooter > Fred > Go Hogs Go > Itch.
2. List (Iain 20:04:49) interpreted as first three finishers J80 > Scalded Dawg > Ambush.
3. Later list (Jackson 20:16:51) gives Scalded Dawg > Ambush > Scooter; consistent assuming Jackson reporting subsequent finishers after J80 already recorded. Combined yields a consistent total order with no contradictions.

No novice declarations naming a boat; all novices = 0.
