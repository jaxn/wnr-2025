[3/24/25, 1:32:35 PM] Jackson: Creating a WhatsApp for WNR to coordinate, share info, trash talk, and maybe help with crew placement. I will use this as the primary channel for weather decisions.

The QR code for the group will be at the marina and anyone participating can request to join. Requests will need to be approved by an admin, but I think all racing skippers can be admins to make that easier.

[4/1/25, 9:48:44 AM] Jackson: The lake level may end up being too low this week. TVA is dropping the level and it will be close to winter pool level on Wednesday. Also, some forecasts are saying it will be gusting 35+.

As always, it is each skipper’s responsibility to decide whether to sail or not. If you know you are not going to sail tomorrow, please let me know so that we can coordinate with available crew who signed up.
[4/1/25, 9:50:59 AM] Ania: I plan on showing up and we'll see what happens!

[4/9/25, 8:03:26 AM] Jackson: FYI: the middle no wake buoy appeared to be missing yesterday. I suspect it is submerged and could be a hazard.  If it is still not visible, the start/finish line will be between the two remaining no wake buoys.
[4/9/25, 8:09:13 AM] David Curtze: It's tied to a submerged tree. When the lake it high, it goes under.  Typically you can see the top and use it as the pin.
[4/9/25, 9:04:00 AM] Bill Elders: I’m in and probably have room for one more on Itch

[4/17/25, 8:47:58 AM] George Darling: @⁨Max Sadler⁩ if you go to look at the J/22 we were talking about, the plastic handle of a screwdriver is the perfect tool for sounding along the deck to listen for wet core spots. Literally anywhere a screw goes through the deck is suspect, and if you find anything you can negotiate off the price.
[4/17/25, 11:13:38 AM] George Heintz: Is this a new option. We already brought wizard homecc
[4/17/25, 11:50:38 AM] Jackson: Yes, Max is looking at a Waterline boat in Annapolis.

[4/30/25, 12:43:16 PM] George Heintz: It is only supposed to work for coming week to keep people from signing up for a bunch and then not showing. May need to be tweaked.

[7/9/25, 4:16:23 PM] Bill Elders: It’s strange out here on pier 1. Lightning across the lake but appears to be moving slowly off to the east and dissipating. Dead calm in the cove at the moment so all wind indicators are pointing different directions. So I guess it’s all on this thing to the south whether it kisses us with its wind or blasts us. Very hard to tell. Russell said they’ve had funk all around but no rain to speak of today. For what it’s worth—very similar to our dinghie racing weather this past Sunday.

[7/9/25, 8:57:34 PM] George Heintz: Go hogs DSQ. Missed a buoy on top end.  Thats what we get for following Scooter.  At least we had 1 Novice.
[7/9/25, 9:25:04 PM] Max Sadler: I followed go hogs!
[7/9/25, 10:02:46 PM] David Curtze: Itch ahead go hogs go behind. 1 nv.
Scooter and go hogs  missed a mark.
Dsq? Consider last and 2nd to last.  If max also missed the mark, then last, 2nd to last and 3rd to last. 
Thuse marks move around so much,  you never know where they are.
[7/9/25, 10:03:19 PM] George Heintz: True that!!!
[7/9/25, 10:13:49 PM] Mark Smith: Honestly, we were fixated on a spinnaker issue so Jesus could’ve been walking on the water and we’d missed it too.
[7/9/25, 10:58:24 PM] Bill Elders: I saw the mark!

What a blast of a night!
[7/9/25, 10:58:59 PM] Bill Elders: Great night of sailing. Gotta go out there
[7/9/25, 11:35:18 PM] Fred Bartrom: Max went back and rounded the mark. finished behind us.
[7/9/25, 11:47:37 PM] James ODell: Anyone that didn’t sail the course should be scored DNF, the rules are very clear on this point.
[7/10/25, 12:29:16 AM] Jackson: We don’t really have SIs for WNR (we should), so I would like to ask if any skipper objects to rule A5.3 being in effect. I feel that is the cleanest way to align series scoring to the spirit of WNR.

In essence, it is DNF (or DSQ, but I think James is right) being scored as the number of boats finishing + 1, instead of the number of boats registered for the series + 1. 

I believe it makes no sense to score a DNC/DNS the same as a boat that went out and made an effort to sail the course.

[7/23/25, 8:24:21 PM] David Curtze: Scooter 2NV. Caper behind

[7/23/25, 9:29:33 PM] Jackson: No one in front.
Ambush.
Wizard behind (I think, it was close)
[7/23/25, 9:32:33 PM] Alicia Noble: Ambush in front, Itch behind
[7/23/25, 9:47:21 PM] George Heintz: For Go Hogs
Psycho in front  - Danger Zone behind.
[7/23/25, 9:59:55 PM] ~ Rob Bourquin: Anyone care that the short course was not announced therefore start times were not adjusted therefore ….
[7/23/25, 10:52:08 PM] Jackson: Yeah, thats a fair point. Not sure what to do about it though. It’s good that so many boats came out with a bad forecast.
[7/24/25, 7:09:44 AM] Sam Beckman: Since I did poorly, i think we should follow the rules and score everyone DNF.
[7/24/25, 8:00:05 AM] Paul Latour: Recommend plant a marker at the now famous "Beckman Hole" so we stay out of there!
I also recommend the Wednesday PRO raise a flag denoting short course per his/her discretion.  The PRO is god in such matters; any complainers automatically enlist to be PRO the next time.
[7/24/25, 8:02:46 AM] George Darling: With the short course start times, the faster boats would have started closer behind the slower boats. Would that have positively or negatively affected your race?
[7/24/25, 8:09:12 AM] Paul Latour: That's called "GOK" in my world so unwise to go there. Just live with what you have and move forward!
[7/24/25, 8:11:59 AM] Bill Elders: Clearly, every boat thought it would be long course at the start and started accordingly. Lead boat made executive decision at the first mark since wind died not to attempt certain misery for everyone. I’m sure all were appreciative of that. That said, moving forward could a designated course flag be flown from the flag staff on the deck steps or even from the docked flag boat?
[7/24/25, 4:09:54 PM] Fred Bartrom: I am DNF for rules violation. We had two novices on board.
[7/24/25, 9:20:16 PM] Bill Elders: Was this picture taken from “The Beckman Hole? ‎<This message was edited>
[7/24/25, 9:29:43 PM] Jackson: It was taken from the finish. But you can see Beckman in the hole

Dead Calm?

Question mark makes it
[7/27/25, 4:36:19 PM] ~ David: Hello! I’m relatively new to sailing and haven’t been to a Wednesday night yet. What time should I be there, and what should I bring? I’m 100% happy to hang around and help/watch for a while before I expect anyone to welcome me on their boat. 

I’ve got an old precision 14 that I’ve toodled around the lake on (and almost capsized a bit ago on a gusty day) and I’d love to learn from some of you more experienced sailors.
[7/27/25, 5:45:45 PM] Mark Smith: Show up around 5 and we’ll get you on a boat. Best way to learn is to come out Wednesdays for several years and learn all the positions on a boat.
[7/27/25, 5:54:33 PM] ~ David: Thanks, Mark! I’ll come o ur.
[7/27/25, 5:54:39 PM] ~ David: Out
[7/27/25, 9:43:52 PM] Brian Dougherty: David:  Learning at the Helm on Tuesday’s is also a great place to start.  We can get you out on a J22 so you can get a beginner experience on a racing boat.  It is a good way to line up with a boat for Wednesday Night Races.

We have 6 people signed up to crew. Kate is out of town this week, so I’d love some help on the dock helping place people tonight.

And the forecast looks mixed. There is a chance we will make a short course. If so, that announcement will be on WhatsApp, no later than 5:50pm

[8/2/25, 9:50:42 AM] ~ Joy Grapentine: Good morning! Anyone know who just took out Manner? I had it reserved this morning...
[8/2/25, 5:38:19 PM] ~ John Calvano: Joy, What happened?
[8/2/25, 5:44:12 PM] ~ Joy Grapentine: It sounds like both parties had reserved the boat before today, but the website didn't save either reservation. When I checked this morning to see if anyone had it reserved after me, I saw my reservation hadn't saved and re-reserved, but the other sailer (understandably) didn't double check this morning--he assumed he had the boat. Just a weird tech glitch! We chatted. All good.
[8/2/25, 8:53:44 PM] Phillip Lehner: Buried him at sea. Got it.
[8/3/25, 8:24:23 AM] ~ John Calvano: Thanks Joy.
[8/4/25, 10:44:00 AM] Mark Smith: There was a drowning at Hamilton Creek Saturday at 2pm. David Holcroft age 74. Adjusting his sail on the bow, waves hit taking him overboard. No life jacket. Yes it’s hot, they are unattractive and annoying but let’s commit to PFDs. Be safe friends.
[8/4/25, 10:57:49 AM] Ania: Did this happen at the marina yesterday? Was he a sailor?

[8/4/25, 11:57:53 AM] Paul Heinz: Considering his wife was on the boat with him and should have been able to toss him a line/off/etc. I'd bet money either there was a head injury on the way down or he was drunk.
[8/4/25, 11:58:03 AM] Paul Heinz: Pfd*
[8/4/25, 11:59:50 AM] Paul Latour: Yes, or stress-induced heart attack.
[8/4/25, 2:54:56 PM] James ODell: Unfortunately, No pfd,
[8/4/25, 5:18:14 PM] Bill Elders: We were there. Zero wind. Zero waves. I don’t know where this would have taken place.
[8/4/25, 5:20:06 PM] ~ Brad: Saturday v Sunday? I thought there was wind Saturday, whereas v15s on Sunday had no wind
[8/4/25, 5:20:59 PM] Bill Elders: I’m sorry, I thought the report said it was on Sunday. Was it Saturday?
[8/4/25, 5:21:11 PM] James ODell: Wake boat is my guess, perfect day for those folks.
[8/4/25, 10:18:24 PM] Brian Dougherty: Our J22 sailing friends at Eagle Creek experienced a similar tragic event last month when a young woman drowned after diving off a sailboat.
[8/4/25, 10:18:58 PM] Brian Dougherty: https://www.wishtv.com/news/local-news/sailboat-diving-tragedy-eagle-creek-reservoir/
[8/4/25, 10:22:14 PM] Brian Dougherty: Another tragic sailing related accident happened last week during youth sailing camp at the Miami Yacht Club.
[8/4/25, 10:22:17 PM] Brian Dougherty: https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/as-loved-ones-mourn-3-girls-killed-in-biscayne-bay-sailboat-crash-victims-attorney-says-there-is-a-lot-of-fault-to-go-around/
[8/4/25, 10:25:54 PM] Brian Dougherty: These tragic events are painful reminders that wearing a life jacket while sailing is a crucial safety practice, no matter your experience level or the conditions. Even strong swimmers can be incapacitated in cold or rough water. Sudden boat movements, weather changes, or slips can send anyone overboard. Calm water can become dangerous in minutes, especially with heavy boat traffic. And, a bright-colored life jacket can help with quick recovery.  

Be aware that recent updates in the law require self-inflating life jackets to be worn. Other standard jackets must fit properly and be readily accessible. 

Best practice is to always wear your PFD while on the water.  Remember that the high freeboard on many sailboats can make getting back onboard a challenge. In the event you end up in the water, you’re life jacket may be the key safety feature that saves your life.

In 2023, among boating fatalities from drowning, 87% of the victims were not wearing a life jacket.

I’m not up to speed on the dry-sailed rating hit. Is that something unique to PPYC? I haven’t heard of other clubs doing that. I agree is should be consistent.

There are now 4 buoys - it looks to me that the mostly-submerged buoy (the pin end of our start) has been removed and two new ones were added.  It appears to me that the start line may be two small using the right two, and we may now need to use the middle two.

If anyone is out there before Wednesday, please take a look and share your thoughts.

[8/10/25, 8:47:23 PM] Jeremy Odom: Has it ever been considered to drop our own small marks to get our start line out of the cove?
[8/10/25, 8:48:01 PM] Brian Dougherty: We observed the same yesterday coming in from J22 Saturday Practice.  

Simple Solution.  
Option 1: Ignore the middle wake buoy
Option 2: Move the other buoys out farther with the middle buoy
Option3: What Jeremy just said
[8/10/25, 10:06:30 PM] Max Sadler: There are two blown up in the shed.
[8/10/25, 10:07:25 PM] Jackson: Dropping marks would be very difficult since start times are based on the distance of the course.
[8/10/25, 10:09:23 PM] ~ John Calvano: Under Option 3, would the last finisher be the one to haul up the marks, rodes and anchors onto their boat and stow them back at the marina? If so, every boat would want to carry containers for them.
[8/10/25, 10:29:48 PM] Paul Latour: Ordinarily, wearing gloves, it is easy to lift these marks and drag where you want them; COE cares not.
[8/11/25, 8:39:51 AM] Bill Elders: If we’re dropping marks, let’s W/L!! 🫠😂
[8/11/25, 4:12:37 PM] George Heintz: Hey Folks.  We have Safety/Chase Boat training scheduled for Sat 23 Aug.  Great prep for RC volunteers (we all should be occasionally volunteering for RC). Please consider attending. Here is a link.

We will cover setting marks and MOB training.

We have had two challenging incidents this season, both with problems while setting marks and a MOB during the Galen Freeman.  

We all need to be better prepared and practice safety procedures.  

It is just like a life jacket, it doesn’t work, if you ignore it. ‎<This message was edited>

[8/27/25, 9:09:56 AM] Sam Beckman: Reminder. According to WNR SI. Short course decision shall be made no later than 5:45. Since Race Director ( Jackson) is out the decision is “ by consensus of 3 or more racing skippers”. Hoping we don’t need it.
[8/27/25, 12:39:32 PM] Ania: I plan on racing today! On club j-22 or whatever most available.
[8/27/25, 12:39:33 PM] Chris Berkey: I’m planning to be there. @⁨David Curtze⁩ I can help you pull Scooter if you want.
-Chris Berkey
[8/27/25, 12:43:14 PM] Chris Berkey: @⁨Ania⁩ club j22 is out unless we reconnect the starboard shroud that became undone when the split ring came out of the pin at the bottom of the turnbuckle.

[8/27/25, 12:53:19 PM] George Heintz: Joe Rocks and people need to tell him so!
[8/27/25, 1:15:55 PM] George Heintz: Reminder to use new starting times if we do short course

https://s3.amazonaws.com/ClubExpressClubFiles/189648/documents/WNR2024_24JulyRev2_1684472550.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIA6MYUE6DNNJ6ROIH3&Expires=1756318728&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DWNR2024_24JulyRev2.pdf&Signature=pNAjlwd8Ima4LA3T95HL9yC6X%2Fo%3D
[8/27/25, 1:59:48 PM] James ODell: I think there may be an error in the starting times. The times are  are based on the long course being 2.8 miles and the short course 2.2 miles. One of those distances is incorrect. The long course is more than .6 miles longer than the short course, it’s probably closer to twice the length. If the starting times are calculated on the above mileage one or both times are incorrect.
[8/27/25, 2:06:48 PM] George Heintz: Sam measured the short course to calculate new times. Long course has not had similar remeasurement. Heck buoys aren’t in same place week to week.  Needs to be measured too.
[8/27/25, 2:08:33 PM] Mark Smith: One design! Do I hear the quiet building whisper of one design racing of keelboats in Nashville?  I know, I know, I’m a fool for dreaming that two sailors can agree on anything but can you stop and imagine 15 J22s or S2s every Wednesday night?  Wow, gives me goosebumps. The comaraderie and competition would be the envy of every club around. I’d be the first to sell any of my boats to start this momentum. Ok, I’ll climb back under my rock now. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/27/25, 2:24:06 PM] Max Sadler: Link doesn't work...
[8/27/25, 2:24:52 PM] Max Sadler: I hear we already decided on J22s 😜
[8/27/25, 3:57:29 PM] Jeff Sonsino: I’m in for a J22 if we are building a fleet.
[8/27/25, 4:02:21 PM] Chris Dupont: Don Yeserski called me, says he tried to sign up and isn’t having success but wants to sail today.
Should I tell him to come on down?
[8/27/25, 4:03:31 PM] Jackson: That probably means the signup is full
[8/27/25, 4:07:17 PM] Chris Dupont: 7/8 from what I saw

[8/28/25, 6:45:00 AM] Alicia Noble: Fred ahead,  Dandelion behind or we’ll call it a tie 😉
[8/28/25, 4:50:39 PM] George Darling: I would like to extend an invitation to all Percy Priest skippers to take part in any of the HIYC keelboat regattas this fall. This year, we clarified in our notice of race documents that the regattas are open to any skippers invited by an HIYC member, so please take this as your official invitation. The regatta dates are Sept 6, Oct 11, Nov 1, Nov 9, Nov 15, Nov 16, and Dec 6. You can register online here (no account needed) https://hiyc.org/calendar 

The regattas on Nov 15 and 16 are long distance races. The rest will be shorter, likely with multiple races in a day with more W/L courses than we have traditionally done.

If there are three or more boats of the same kind, we've also clarified that you may opt to race one-design! We only have plans for trophies for our regular PHRF fleets however, since we don't know who to expect at this point.
[8/28/25, 4:56:37 PM] George Heintz: Nice touch. Definitely will consider.
[8/28/25, 8:49:13 PM] David Curtze: Thanks George D.
[8/31/25, 11:33:12 AM] Brian Smokler: What George Darling said. I guess I don't read the race instructions well enough. Our races have always been open to anyone who wants to participate. We have guest slips if anyone want to bring a boat over. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/2/25, 4:04:59 PM] Fred Bartrom: Rookie Race training is this Saturday 1:00-4:00. Then the Rookie Race is the following Saturday, the 13th. 

1. Training: Sam Beckman will be helping teach the class. He is great with so many topics. I could use one more person to help with the teaching this Saturday. I have several additional topics to choose from. Reach out to me and I will plug you in.

2. Race Day: Saturday the 13th. 
	A. I would like to offer an experienced sailor to take my boat out to coach and help Rookies experience the race. It is Jib and Main only on a simple triangle course.
        B.  I will be running the race and could use a couple of people to help with that as well. We need someone who can operate the mark boat (three marks) and a couple of helpers one on the mark boat and one on the committee boat. We really keep this race simple and fun.
	C. If you have a boat, we need other skippers to come out and host Rookies on your boat. Bring a rookie or two with you! Thanks for those who have already signed up!
[9/3/25, 12:04:14 PM] Jackson: Today is the day.  There are only 4 more WNR left in the season.

[9/11/25, 6:30:34 AM] Mark Smith: Last night’s race was a joy. Light but steady breeze with the typical Hamilton Creek new breeze finish, temps were not sweat to death hot. For me when I’m on the boat concentrating on getting every ounce of speed allows me to escape. Yesterday was a tough day in our country but just another chapter in a tough season for our country. Our sailing community, what we are creating with these sailboats, is something special. We don’t talk politics (what’s the point) we just love and enjoy each other. Sailing with an old friend, Steve, newer friends, Jess, Emily and Carolina, and a newest one, Antonio, just makes me smile. Thanks Bill for letting us use Itch. See everyone on the water! Just show up and be surprised
[9/11/25, 6:32:27 AM] Alicia Noble: Ambush ahead, Wizard, Itch behind.
[9/11/25, 9:55:09 AM] Chris Berkey: Beatit: Dnf due to late start, dead battery, so no lights to stay out on course with. Not the point, we had a great time and just getting the boat back out there was the win. Boat feels great, seemed nimble and responsive to control in the light wind. We have a few technical issue we found to solve but that’s all part of it.
[9/11/25, 9:56:52 AM] Chris Berkey: Very much enjoyed and appreciated the assembled crew of Kate, Robbie and Asa for maiden voyage! Thanks to all who got them in contact with me to crew!
[9/11/25, 10:49:02 AM] George Heintz: Congrats. Welcome to the PPYC Fleet!
